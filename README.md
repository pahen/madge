# MaDGe - Module Dependency Graph

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/pahen/node-madge.png)](http://travis-ci.org/pahen/node-madge)

Create graphs from your [CommonJS](http://nodejs.org/api/modules.html) or [AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD) module dependencies. Could also be useful for finding circular dependencies in your code. Tested on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) projects. Dependencies are calculated using static code analysis. CommonJS dependencies are found using James Halliday's [detective](https://github.com/substack/node-detective) and for AMD I'm using some parts copied from James Burke's [RequireJS](https://github.com/jrburke/requirejs) (both are using [UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS)). Modules written in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) with extension .coffee are supported and will automatically be compiled on-the-fly.

## Examples
Here's a very simple example of a generated image.

![](https://github.com/pahen/node-madge/raw/master/examples/small.png)

 - blue = has dependencies
 - green = has no dependencies
 - red = has circular dependencies

Here's an example generated from the [Express](https://github.com/visionmedia/express) project.

And some terminal usage.

# Installation

To install as a library:

	$ npm install madge

To install the command-line tool:

	$ sudo npm -g install madge

## Graphviz (optional)

Only required if you want to generate the visual graphs using [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/).

### Mac OS X

	$ sudo port install graphviz

### Ubuntu

	$ sudo apt-get install graphviz

# API

	var madge = require('madge');
	var dependencyObject = madge('./');
	console.log(dependencyObject.tree);

## madge(src, opts)

{Object|Array|String} **src** (required)

- Object - a dependency tree.
- Array - an Array of directories to scan.
- String - a directory to scan.

{Object} **opts** (optional)

- {String} **format**. The module format to expect, 'cjs' or 'amd'. Commonjs (cjs) is the default format.
- {String} **exclude**. String from which a regex will be constructed for excluding files from the scan.
- {Boolean} **breakOnError**. True if the parser should stop on parse errors and when modules are missing, false otherwise. Defaults to false.

## dependency object (returned from madge)

#### .opts

Options object passed used in the constructor.

#### .tree

Dependency tree object. Can be overwritten with an object in the format:

	{
	     'module1': [ 'dep1a', 'dep1b' ],
	     'module2': ['dep2a']
	}

#### .obj()

Alias to the tree property.

#### .circular()

Returns all the modules with circular dependencies.

#### .depends()

Returns a list of modules that depends on a given module.

#### .dot()

Get a DOT representation of the module dependency graph.

#### .image(opts, callback)

Get an image representation of the module dependency graph.

- {Object} **opts** (required).
	- {String} **layout**. The layout to use. Defaults to 'DOT'.
	- {String} **fontFace**. The font face to use. Defaults to 'Times-Roman'.
	- {Object} **imageColors**. Object with color information (all colors are strings containing hex values).
		- {String} **bgcolor**. The backgound color.
		- {String} **edge**. The edge color.
		- {String} **dependencies**. The color for dependencies and for text if fontColor is not present.
		- {String} **fontColor**. The color for text.
- {Function} **callback** (required). Receives the rendered image as the first argument.

# CLI

	Options:
	  -h, --help              output usage information
	  -V, --version           output the version number
	  -f, --format <name>     format to parse (amd/cjs)
	  -o, --output <type>     output format (plain/json)
	  -s, --summary           show summary of all dependencies
	  -c, --circular          show circular dependencies
	  -d, --depends <id>      show modules that depends on the given id
	  -x, --exclude <regex>   a regular expression for excluding modules
	  -t, --dot               output graph in the DOT language
	  -i, --image <filename>  write graph to file as a PNG image
	  -l, --layout <name>     layout engine to use for image graph (dot/neato/fdp/sfdp/twopi/circo)
	  -b, --break-on-error    break on parse errors & missing modules
	  -n, --no-colors         skip colors in output and images
	  -r, --read              skip scanning folders and read JSON from stdin
	  -C, --config <filename> provide a config file


## Examples:

### List all module dependencies (CommonJS)

	$ madge /path/src

### List all module dependencies (AMD)

	$ madge --format amd /path/src

### Finding circular dependencies

	$ madge --circular /path/src

### Show modules that depends on a given module

	$ madge --depends 'wheels' /path/src

### Excluding modules

	$ madge --exclude '^foo$|^bar$|^tests' /path/src

### Save graph as a PNG image (graphviz required)

	$ madge --image graph.png /path/src

### Save graph as a [DOT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_language) file for further processing (graphviz required)

	$ madge --dot /path/src > graph.gv

### Pipe predefined results (the example image was produced with the following command)

	$ cat << EOF | madge --read --image example.png
	{
		"a": ["b", "c", "d"],
		"b": ["c"],
		"c": [],
		"d": ["a"]
	}
	EOF

## Config (use with --config)

	{
	    "format": "amd",
	    "image": "dependencyMap.png",
	    "fontFace": "Arial",
	    "fontSize": "14px",
	    "imageColors": {
	        "noDependencies" : "#0000ff",

	        "bgcolor": "#ffffff"
	    }
	}

# FAQ

## The image produced by madge is very hard to read, what's wrong?

Try running madge with a different layout, here's a list of the ones you can try:

* **dot**	"hierarchical" or layered drawings of directed graphs. This is the default tool to use if edges have directionality.

* **neato** "spring model'' layouts.  This is the default tool to use if the graph is not too large (about 100 nodes) and you don't know anything else about it. Neato attempts to
minimize a global energy function, which is equivalent to statistical multi-dimensional scaling.

* **fdp**	"spring model'' layouts similar to those of neato, but does this by reducing forces rather than working with energy.

* **sfdp** multiscale version of fdp for the layout of large graphs.

* **twopi** radial layouts, after Graham Wills 97. Nodes are placed on concentric circles depending their distance from a given root node.

* **circo** circular layout, after Six and Tollis 99, Kauffman and Wiese 02. This is suitable for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures, such as certain telecommunications networks.
